<b>On-Chain vs Off-Chain transactions</b>
1. On-Chain: transactions reflected on the public ledger, visible to all participants on the blockchain network
2. Off-Chain: transactions that aren't processed on the main chain (usually achieved through state channels)

<b>Advantages to off-chain transactions:</b>
* Cheaper - they are usually free as there is no participant required to validate the transaction
* Faster - transactions are recorded immediately without having to wait for network confirmations
* More privacy - transfers are not visible on the public blockchain

<b>State Channels</b> <br />
A State Channel is in essence a two-way discussion channel between users, or between a user and a service (a machine)
